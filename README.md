This repository contains implementation of various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network using transfer learning and the neural networks are fine tuned for DR grading.
Here, we used Messidor and Augmented Messidor data for training and test.

The code for data augmentation is also available in this repository.
For each model the accuracy Vs epoch and loss Vs epoch graphs are also plotted.
